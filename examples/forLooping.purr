//Example of for looping with and without a break

//List of cats:
cats = ["garfield", "cleopatra", "sphinx"]

//Will print garfield cleopatra sphinx
fur cat in cats:
    meow(cat)
nap

//Will print cleopatra
fur cat in cats:
    if cat == "sphinx" || cat == "garfield":
        break
    else
        meow(cat)
    nap
nap
