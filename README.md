# Introduction:
There was once a cat, and her name was Kis. She double majored in computer science and felinology (study of cats)
at the Kitties Tech University. In her junior year of college she realized there were no programming languages designed by cats, they were all designed by these weird beings called, "humans." In the Spring of 2024, Kis set off to design her own programming language and named it after herself. Instead of using words like "print", "for", "while", "end", and "function", she chose words cats are more familiar with. In addition to that, this is how she described her language...

Kis is a sophisticated, statically-typed programming language designed for modern software development needs. Its rich type system supports both primitive and user-defined types, enhanced by advanced features like generics and type inference, allowing developers to write expressive, yet type-safe code. A distinctive feature of Kis is its support for function and operator overloading, enabling context-specific behaviors of functions and operators based on argument types, thereby enhancing the language's flexibility and expressiveness.

Kis also places a strong emphasis on immutability, offering immutable data types to ensure safer and more predictable code, particularly beneficial in concurrent programming scenarios. Furthermore, Kis features a module system, complete with import/export capabilities, encouraging modularity and code reuse. This comprehensive suite of features positions Kis as a powerful tool for developers looking to leverage the benefits of modern language design in both system-level and high-level application development.

# Features:

1. Rich Type System:

- Includes primitive types and user-defined types.
- Advanced features like generics allow for creating functions and data structures that can operate on different types without sacrificing type safety.
- Type inference reduces the need for explicit type declarations, making the language more concise and readable.

2. Function Overloading and Operator Overloading:

- Functions and operators can behave differently based on their argument types.
- This adds complexity to type checking as the compiler must determine the correct function or operator to use based on the context.

3. Immutable Data Types:

- Once created, objects of these types cannot be modified.
- This feature is crucial for functional programming paradigms and can help in writing safer, more predictable code.
- The language runtime and compiler must enforce and optimize the use of immutable data.
